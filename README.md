## Description

A coding bootcamp provides a significant amount of information. It can be difficult to keep track of everything you learn so I built a study guide to help me take notes and learn during the process of building it. Now I have an accessable and stylized webpage to track my notes and progress as I go. I learned how to write HTML and build the framework of a webpage using markdown; learning how to create lists, headers, and sections is essential for proper formatting. Although HTML can accomplish a simple webpage, using CSS to personalize and bring the webpage to life was a crucial next step. I learned how to adjust the margin, padding, color, and call classes from the HTML file in order to stylize with more precision and DRY code. The final step to my project was adding a JavaScript file. I learned how to define a variable and create loops, functions and if statemants. The final step was to link my javascript and CSS code to the main html file.
